# Jeep Avenger Car Manual

## Starting and Driving

### START AND OPERATING

**NEW VEHICLE RUNNING-IN**  
Do not brake unnecessarily hard for the first few journeys. During the first drive, smoke may occur because of wax and oil evaporating off the exhaust system. Park the vehicle in the open for a while after the first drive and avoid inhaling the fumes. During the running-in period, fuel and engine oil consumption may be higher. Additionally, the cleaning process of the exhaust filter may take place more often.

**VEHICLES WITH IGNITIONSWITCH**  
Turn key to position 1 to release the steering wheel lock.  
Manual transmission: operate clutch and brake pedal.  
Electric Drive Unit: operate brake pedal. Do not operate accelerator pedal.  
Turn key briefly to position 2 and release after engine has been started.  
Manual transmission with Adaptive Cruise Control: during an Autostop, the engine can be started by depressing the clutch pedal  
Electric Drive Unit with Adaptive Cruise Control: during an Autostop, the engine can be started by releasing the brake pedal.  

**VEHICLES WITH STOP START ENGINE BUTTON**  
- Manual transmission: select neutral gear, operate clutch and brake pedal.
- Electric Drive Unit: operate brake pedal.
- Do not operate accelerator pedal.
- Press the STOP START ENGINE button.
- Release button after starting procedure begins.
- Before restarting or to switch off the engine when vehicle is stationary, press the STOP START ENGINE button once more briefly.  
To start the engine during an Autostop (with Adaptive Cruise Control):
- Manual transmission: during an Autostop, the engine can be started by depressing the clutch pedal
- Electric Drive Unit: during an Autostop, the engine can be started by releasing the brake pedal
  
Operation in case of failure

If either the electronic key fails or the battery of the electronic key is weak, a message may be displayed in the instrument panel display.  
Hold the electronic key at the marking on the steering column cover as shown in the illustration fig. 170.  
On vehicles with manual transmission, select neutral gear, operate the clutch pedal, the brake pedal and press the STOP START ENGINE button.  
On vehicles with Electric Drive Unit, set the PRND command to position P, operate the brake pedal and press the STOP START ENGINE button.  
This option is intended for emergencies only. Replace the electronic key battery as soon as possible.  

**ELECTRIC VERSIONS**  
The PRND command must be in position P or N. Proceed as follows: 
- fully depress the brake pedal without touching the accelerator 
- press the STOP START ENGINE button to take the ignition switch to the position 3. Hold it fully depressed for a couple of seconds.  
At the end of the procedure, an acoustic warning will be heard and the message "READY" will appear on the instrument panel display to indicate that the electric traction system of the car has started.  
When the "READY" message appears, the car is ready to go.

**EMERGENCY SHUT OFF DURING DRIVING**  
If the engine needs to be switched off during driving in case of emergency, press the STOP START ENGINE button for 5 seconds.

**COLD START RECOMMENDATIONS**  
Starting the engine without additional heaters is possible down to -30Â°C for petrol engines. Required is an engine oil with the correct viscosity, the correct fuel, performed services and a sufficiently charged conventional vehicle battery. It is necessary to do as follows:
- run the engine (idle speed) at least 1 min before take-off vehicle
- in very cold conditions, the enjoyability of use will be reached after a few kilometres

**TURBO ENGINE WARM-UP**  
Upon start-up, engine available torque may be limited for a short time, especially when the engine temperature is cold. The limitation is to allow the lubrication system to fully protect the engine.

**OVERRUN CUT-OFF**  
The fuel supply is automatically cut off during overrun, i.e. when the vehicle is driven with a gear engaged but accelerator pedal is released.
Depending on driving conditions, the overrun cut-off may be deactivated.

_**WARNING**_

1. It is dangerous to run the engine in enclosed areas. The engine consumes oxygen and engine exhaust contains carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other toxic gasses.
2. The brake servo is not active until the engine is started, so you would need to apply much more force than usual to the brake pedal.
3. Do not start the engine by pushing, towing or driving downhill. These manoeuvres may damage the catalytic converter.
4. Do not leave the vehicle in a poorly ventilated area with electrical operating mode on and heat engine switched off, as the heat engine may start automatically if the residual charge level of the high-voltage battery is insufficient. The exhaust gases generated can cause serious damage to people and animals.
5. When leaving the vehicle, you must set the PRND command to P. If you unintentionally press the accelerator pedal or when the PRND command is in a position other than P the vehicle can move abruptly, resulting in serious injury or death.
6. Switching off the engine during driving may cause loss of power support for brake and steering systems. Assistance systems and airbag systems are disabled. Lighting and brake lights will extinguish. Therefore power down the engine and ignition while driving only when required in case of emergency.

_**IMPORTANT**_

1. When the engine is switched off never leave the ignition device in the ENGINE position to prevent useless current absorption from draining the conventional battery.
2. A quick burst on the accelerator before turning off the engine serves absolutely no practical purpose; it wastes fuel and is damaging for the engine.
3. We recommend that during the initial period, or during the first 1600 km (1000 miles), you do not drive to full car performance (e.g. excessive acceleration, long journeys at top speed, sharp braking, etc.).

### PARKING

Always remove the key from the ignition device when leaving the car.  
When parking and leaving the car, proceed as follows:
- On versions equipped with the manual transmission, engage the gear (on a slope, engage 1st gear if the vehicle is facing uphill or reverse if it is facing downhill) and leave the wheels steered.  
On versions equipped with an Electric Drive Unit, put the PRND command on P before releasing the brake pedal
- stop the engine and apply the electric parking brake
- lock the vehicle
- activate the anti-theft alarm system  
Block the wheels with a wedge or a stone if the car is parked on a steep slope.  
The engine cooling fans may run after the engine has been switched off
WARNING:  NEVER leave the car with the transmission in neutral (or, on versions with Electric Drive Unit before putting the PRND command in P).
WARNING: In the event of an accident with airbag deployment, the engine is switched off automatically if the vehicle comes to a standstill within a certain time.  
In countries with extremely low temperatures it may be necessary to park the vehicle without applied parking brake. Make sure to park the vehicle on a level surface.


_**WARNING**_

1. Do not park the vehicle on an easily ignitable surface. The high temperature of the exhaust system could ignite the surface. Always apply the parking brake. If the vehicle is on a level surface or uphill slope, engage first gear or set the PRND command to position P. If the vehicle is on a downhill slope, engage reverse gear or set the PRND command to position P. Turn the front wheels towards the kerb. Close the windows. Switch off the engine. Remove the ignition key from the ignition switch or switch off ignition on vehicles with STOP START ENGINE button. Turn the steering wheel until the steering wheel lock is felt to engage.
2. Never leave children unattended in the vehicle. Always remove the ignition key when leaving the vehicle and take it out with you.
   
_**IMPORTANT**_

1. After running at high engine speeds or with high engine loads, operate the engine briefly at a low load or run in neutral for approx. 30 seconds before switching off, in order to protect the turbocharger.
